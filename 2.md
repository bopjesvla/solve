# 2a

To allow for simpler implementation, the problem was reframed. Since goal checking should occur after the cups are filled but before the cups are emptied, emptying followed by filling was considered a single step, rather than the other way around. The consequence of this is that the fullest cup is emptied before the first filling occurs. To accommodate for this, the 7th cup was initialized to 4 units:

```
MODULE main
VAR a1:real; VAR a2:real; VAR a3:real; VAR a4:real; VAR a5:real; VAR a6:real; VAR a7:real;
INIT a1=2 INIT a2=2 INIT a3=2 INIT a4=2 INIT a5=2 INIT a6=2
INIT a7=4
```

The 7th cup is emptied by 2 units before the first filling, resulting in the initial conditions in the problem description.

After each step, i.e. between filling and emptying, the total amount should be 16:

```
TRANS next(a1)+ next(a2)+ next(a3)+ next(a4)+ next(a5)+ next(a6)+ next(a7) = 16
```

When a cup is not emptied, the lower bound for its contents remain its current value. When a cup is emptied, the lower bound decreases by 2 units. In cases where multiple cups are the fullest cup, the highest-index cup is emptied:

```
TRANS case a1>a2& a1>a3& a1>a4& a1>a5& a1>a6& a1>a7 : next(a1) >= a1 - 2; TRUE : next(a1) >= a1; esac
& case a2 >= a1 & a2>a3& a2>a4& a2>a5& a2>a6& a2>a7 : next(a2) >= a2 - 2; TRUE : next(a2) >= a2; esac
& case a3>=a1& a3>=a2& a3>a4& a3>a5& a3>a6& a3>a7 : next(a3) >= a3 - 2; TRUE : next(a3) >= a3; esac
& case a4>=a1& a4>=a2& a4>=a3& a4>a5& a4>a6& a4>a7 : next(a4) >= a4 - 2; TRUE : next(a4) >= a4; esac
& case a5>=a1& a5>=a2& a5>=a3& a5>=a4& a5>a6& a5>a7 : next(a5) >= a5 - 2; TRUE : next(a5) >= a5; esac
& case a6>=a1& a6>=a2& a6>=a3& a6>=a4& a6>=a5& a6>a7 : next(a6) >= a6 - 2; TRUE : next(a6) >= a6; esac
& case a7>=a1& a7>=a2& a7>=a3& a7>=a4& a7>=a5& a7>=a6 : next(a7) >= a7 - 2; TRUE : next(a7) >= a7; esac
```

For example, a1 is only emptied when its contents are strictly greater than a2's, but a2's contents are also removed when they are equal to a1's, breaking the tie.

The goal was first set to check whether the first cup could not overflow:

```
LTLSPEC G !( a1 > 7)
```

A counterexample could be found in 7 steps:

```
-- no counterexample found with bound 0
-- no counterexample found with bound 1
-- no counterexample found with bound 2
-- no counterexample found with bound 3
-- no counterexample found with bound 4

-- no counterexample found with bound 6
-- specification  G !(a1 > 7)  is false

For the second exercise, z3py was used as the API was more familiar and better-documented.

```
from utils import *
from z3 import *
import numpy as np

sol = Solver()
```

Declare the number of cups:

```
nrcups = 7
```

Declare the number of steps we're checking. This was manually incremented from 1 to 6, at which point a solution was found.

```
bound = 6
```

Create a step-cup matrix. The first axis represents time, the second axis represents the cup index, and a cell value represents the contents of the corresponding cup at a certain time.

```
x = np.array([[Real(f"x({t},{c})") for c in range(nrcups)] for t in range(bound)])
```

As before, initialize the cup contents, giving the last cup four units:

```
for v_init in x[0,:-1]:
    sol.add(v_init == 2)

sol.add(x[0,-1] == 4)
```

## 4: Timetabling

![Senior tracks in the secondary school system](profieldeel-vwo.png){#fig1}

Constructing a timetable for large Dutch secondary schools cannot easily be done by hand, because senior students follow different tracks. In the VWO system, the problem is compounded by the fact that tracks are only partially fixed and students can pick one course which does not relate to their track at all (\autoref{fig1}), often resulting in over fifty unique course lists.

We show that in a simplified setting,
